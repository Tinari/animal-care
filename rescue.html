				<h4>ANIMALS NEED YOUR HELP!</h4>
				<p>
					We are rescuers, divers, speleologist, alpinists, members of specific units, we have specific skills, we are veterinaries, lawyers, economists, designers, programmers, private company owners, but also students, pupils, officials, clerks and pensioners. Do you have anything to add to our list?
				</p>
				<p>
					If you like animals and think that they have equal rights to be rescued same as everybody else, we invite you to join us! If you do not think you are skilled enough to climb up a tree, down a manhole, swim in a frozen lake or swift river, there are many other really important tasks that can help animals, which you can successfully realize with our team and equally contribute to the quality of our organizationâ€™s work.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Help Out in our Temporary Shelter for Animals</h4>
				<p>
					Our furry and feathery friends in temporary shelter are waiting specially for you to feed them, pet them, give them their medicine or clean their space. They will be immensely grateful to you, and you will see that in their eyes when they play with you.
